# ListDirectory-LR
LR (List Directory) is a linux tool. It saves your frequently used directories in Linux. With LR, you can enter long path much easier. I have reimplemented LR from qcd.

How to install?
$ git clone
$ cd lr
$ sudo ./install
Now, you can use it.

Try LR:
$ lr -?
$ lr -h

Add your directory:
$ lr -a /home/$USERNAME/Documents/workspace
